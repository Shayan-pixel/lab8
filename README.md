GET FIT GYM Management System Website
Project Overview
This project is a set of static web pages designed for a hypothetical "GET FIT GYM" as part of a basic Gym Management System. It is built entirely using HTML5 for structure and CSS3 for styling (via style.css).

The website provides a basic digital presence, including key information about the gym and a dedicated form for membership sign-ups.

Repository Contents and File Structure
The project files are organized in the following manner:

index.html (Home Page): The main landing page.

Features a special offer banner ("20% off on all memberships").

Includes a placeholder for a custom image (assets/img.jpg).

about.html (About Us Page): Details the gym's mission, facilities, and dedicated team.

Focuses on providing top-notch fitness facilities and personalized support.

membership.html (Membership Page): Contains detailed information on plans and a sign-up form.

Plans Listed: Basic ($40/month), Standard ($60/month), and Premium ($90/month).

Admission Form: Collects user details (Name, Email, Phone, Membership Type) and comments.

style.css: The external stylesheet linked to all HTML pages for design and layout.

README.md: This file.

All pages share a common header (with navigation for Home, About Us, and Membership) and a footer (with the copyright notice: &copy; 2024 GET FIT GYM).
